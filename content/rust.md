Libraries that I'm using for my projects and can recommend:

- [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/), a minimalist game engine that deserves more attention
- [Rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio), easy to use sound playback library.
   I've used it to code a [sampler](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/libretakt) and a [synthesiser](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/nosna)
- [Rust.audio](https://rust.audio/), collection of resources dedicated to audio programming in Rust

Other links that I found interesting:

- [Delegate crate](https://lib.rs/crates/delegate)
- [faster than lime blog](https://fasterthanli.me/about)
- [A cool guy whose talk I've attended at a Rust Meetup in Wroc≈Çaw](https://pwy.io/en/)
