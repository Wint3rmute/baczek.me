Rust is my current language of choice - it offers great
developer experience, powerful type system and a wide range
of libraries. Here are some of the libraries that I'm using
for my projects and can recommend:

- [Macroquad](https://macroquad.rs/), a minimalist game engine that deserves more attention
- [Rodio](https://github.com/RustAudio/rodio), easy to use sound playback library.
  I've used it to code a [sampler](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/libretakt) and a [synthesiser](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/nosna)
- [Egui](https://egui.rs) - an immediate mode GUI library,supporting desktop, mobile and web
- [Rust.audio](https://rust.audio/), collection of resources dedicated to audio programming in Rust
