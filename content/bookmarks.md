Inspired by [Devine's idea](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/bookmarks.html),
who was in turn inspired by [marginalia.nu](https://memex.marginalia.nu/log/19-website-discoverability-crisis.gmi):

>Create a list of bookmarks linking to websites you find interesting,
>and publish it for the world to see. It's a bit strange,
>almost nobody seems to be doing this. Looking through a sample of
>personal websites, very few of them has links to other personal websites.
>A hyperlink isn't a marriage proposal. It is enough to find some
>redeeming quality in a website to link to it. It costs nothing,
>and helps bring traffic to pages that you yourself think deserve it.
