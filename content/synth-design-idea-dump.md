title: Custom synth design idea dump
tags: culture
---

I've zero experience when it comes to making any kind of hardware,
but I can still dream of making a custom synthesiser, can't I?

Adding to my bucket list: making any machine capable of making musical sounds.

*TODO:* what synthesis method should it utilise, what sounds should it be able to make?
