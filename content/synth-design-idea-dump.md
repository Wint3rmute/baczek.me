## Idea dump for a custom hardware synth

I've zero experience when it comes to making any kind of
hardware, but I can still dream of making a custom
synthesiser, can't I?

Adding to my bucket list: making any machine
capable of making musical sounds.

*TODO:* what synthesis method should it utilise, what sounds should it be able to make?

Real wood and a floral pattern - could be used as a front panel or a frame around it.

I like the tuning scale behind a plastic cover. Could be
used to display shortcuts or visualize some element of
synth internals.
