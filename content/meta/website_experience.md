# Notes on the browsing experience i strive for

## Tags

I don't think that a hierarchical, filesystem-alike blog structure reflects my
way of thinking very well (I believe it's also true for most people).

Unfortunately, I haven't found any simple tags-indexing search solutions that
would allow me to easily navigate through the site as I'm editing it.
Perhaps `fzf` + some custom search expression/plugin would work well here.

## Navigation

Since I'm using tags, the posts are loosely interconnected, which makes navigation
less predictable (and in my opinion more enjoyable). I'd love to extend this unpredictability
by using some sort of data clustering algorithm (think t-SNE but I'm no expert here)
to automagically generate `related posts` links.

Sounds pretentious enough to make a nice headline
