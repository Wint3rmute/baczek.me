# The Assistant

Logic game idea dump. Alternative titles:

- Assistant
- Lab Assistant
- ... that's it, stop bikeshedding!

## Core idea

Have the player complete logical puzzles, with the "help" of an LLM. The player
moves around in the environment, but it's the LLM who controls the environment:

- Opening doors
- Activating various equipment
- Killing the player due to _unclear instructions_

The player has to instruct the LLM before entering the level. Once the level is
entered, the player can only interact with the LLM using a limited set of
signals (pressing buttons, waving at cameras, etc).

## Worldbuilding

**Question:** What environmets are mostly controlled by automation, where would make sense to have an AI plugged in into every system?

**Answer:** Factories and laboratories!

### Laboratory setting

You are a scientist, who is trapped in a research facility, which has undergone
a major incident (i know, common trope). The devices you're usually using to
control facility's systems stopped working! There's some sort of radio
interference going on, preventing you from things as simple as opening doors.

You can, however, interact with the _newly installed AI Assistant_ in the
facility. The Assistant can be accessed and instructed through terminals,
scattered accross the map. Once you instruct The Assistant on how to act, you
can enter a room in the facility. With luck, the assistant will help you to
progress through the room.
