This is an automatically generated graph of all pages on my websites, along
with the connections chosen by a text vectorisation algorithm. If you're
interested, you can read the [source
code](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/baczek.me/blob/master/related_generator/).


## How is this thing generated?

1. All of the posts are fed through an embeddings generator, I'm using the
   [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) Python library.
2. The embeddings are passed to [UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426)
   dimensionality reduction algorithm, which takes in multi-dimensional
   embeddings and projects it down to a 2D representation.
4. I'm connecting each post with its top 3 nearest posts (using 4 or more leads
   to clutter).
5. The final graph is drawn by `graphviz` and outputted as an SVG file.


### Future plans

1. Make this thing look more map-alike
2. Experiment with text clusterisation & dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as:
    - tSNE
    - K-means clustering
    - UMAP
    - Latent Dirichlet allocation
    - DBSCAN
3. Add #tags. 
4. Introduce color-coding and other visual markers, allowing viewers to make sense of the data based on different metrics:
    - Post tags
    - Links to/from other posts
    - Links outside (to the *netsphere*)
    - Last edited time ([check pygit](https://www.pygit2.org/index.html)) 
    - Other connections generated by NLP
5. Generate a *mini-map* below each page, containing links to the posts *"around"* it.
