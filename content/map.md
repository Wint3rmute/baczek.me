This is an automatically generated graph of all
pages on my websites, along with the connections
chosen by a text vectorisation algorithm.

If you're interested, you can read the
[source code](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/Wint3rmute.github.io/blob/master/related_generator//).


## How is this thing generated?

*TODO: update once I'm finished with UMAP*

1. All of the posts are fed through a stemming algorithm, which reduces them
   to their root form (think *"doing"* -> *"do"*, *"derivation"* -> *"deriv"*).
2. All the posts are fed into a *TF-IDF vectorizer*, which assigns a unique
   index to each unique word and weights them by the frequency in which it appears.
   For example, the word *"to"* probably won't be an important word, opposed to
   *"circumvolution"* or *"simulacrum"*. After this procedure, each post becomes
   a vector of numbers containing the amount of occurences of each unique word
   found in all of the posts, multiplied by the *value* of each word.
3. Post similiarity is compared by using a metric called *cosine similiarity*,
   calculated from the vectors obtained in the 2nd step.
4. I'm connecting each post with its top 3 similiar posts (using 4 or more leads to clutter).
5. This graph is drawn by `graphviz`, it automatically generates the layout.


### Future plans

1. Make this thing look more map-alike
2. Experiment with text clusterisation & dimensionality reduction algorithms, such as:
    - tSNE
    - K-means clustering
    - UMAP
    - Latent Dirichlet allocation
    - DBSCAN
3. Add #tags. 
4. Introduce color-coding and other visual markers, allowing viewers to make sense of the data based on different metrics:
    - Post tags
    - Links to/from other posts
    - Links outside (to the *netsphere*)
    - Last edited time ([check pygit](https://www.pygit2.org/index.html)) 
    - Other connections generated by NLP
5. Generate a *mini-map* below each page, containing links to the posts *"around"* it.
