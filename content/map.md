This is an automatically generated graph containing all pages on my websites,
along with the connections calculated using sentence embeddings. If you're
interested, you can read the [source
code](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/baczek.me/blob/master/exocortex.ipynb).


## How is this thing generated?

1. All of the posts are fed through an embeddings generator, I'm using the
   [Sentence Transformers](https://www.sbert.net/) Python library.
2. The embeddings are passed to [UMAP](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426), a
   dimensionality reduction algorithm, which takes in multi-dimensional
   embeddings and projects it down to a 2D representation, which can be drawn
   as a graph. The projection is done so that the high-level "structure" of the data is preserved.
3. I'm connecting each post with its top 2 nearest posts (using more clutters
   up the map).
4. `graphviz` renders the graph and outputs it as an SVG file.

A much better description on [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/23/embeddings/).

### Future plans

1. Make this thing look more "map-alike", whatever that might mean.
2. Experiment with text clusterisation & dimensionality reduction algorithms,
such as:
    - tSNE
    - K-means clustering
    - UMAP
    - Latent Dirichlet allocation
    - DBSCAN
3. Add #tags. 
4. Introduce color-coding and other visual markers, allowing viewers to make
sense of the data based on different metrics:
    - Post tags
    - Links to/from other posts
    - Links outside (to the *netsphere*)
    - Other connections generated by NLP
