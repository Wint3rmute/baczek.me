title: Custom sequencer idea dump
---

- Think tracker but scriptable in a repl-like manner
- Everything should be changeable in real time
- Runes/Opcodes for sound modification
- Do I need math operators like in orca?
- It should be possible to "carry" packets of data around the program (like a packet of information containing a sound trigger info)
- How should if statements work?
- Song transitions, pattern muting?
