# Hardware

- ThinkPad x260

# Distro + Essentials

- Arch Linux + [NixOS](/nixos) (transition on hold)
- [LeftWm](http://leftwm.org/) - part of [better rust alternatives](/alternatives)
- My semi-custom [color theme](/theme)

# Development

- [LunarVim](https://lunarvim.org)
- [Neovide](https://neovide.dev) (only sometimes, when I feel like watching the cool cursor animations)
