# Repo

[It's all hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/dotfiles), with an
Ansible playbook for auto-deployments. You can read the breakdown of the most
important parts below.

# Hardware

- ThinkPad x260 + Asus GL553VE
- Keyboard: Keychron K1 Slim

# Distro + Essentials

- Arch Linux/[NixOS](/nixos) (transition on hold)
- [LeftWm](http://leftwm.org/) - part of [better alternatives to C
  software](/alternatives)
- [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) as a terminal - Enjoying the
  GPU-accelerated performance and the ligatures
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) for a smarter `cd`
- Firefox (yes, you should be using it instead of anything Chromium-based)
- [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/) for jamming & [making
  sounds](/making-music-linux).

# Development

- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com)
- [Neovide](https://neovide.dev) (only sometimes, when I feel like watching the cool cursor animations)

# Color Theme

I'm using a uniform colour scheme for every piece of software I'm using
(browser, code editors, terminals, GTK and QT apps, this website, etc).
It's based on the color scheme from [Material Theme](https://material-theme.com/).
