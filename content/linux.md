# Hardware

- ThinkPad x260 + Asus GL553VE
- *TODO*: update ~~when the keyboard ships~~ when my gf gives it back ;-;


# Distro + Essentials

- Arch Linux/[NixOS](/nixos) (transition on hold)
- [LeftWm](http://leftwm.org/) - part of [better alternatives to C software](/alternatives)
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) as a terminal - I love the performance and the ligatures
- Firefox (yes, you should be using it instead of anything Chromium-based) 


# Development

- [LunarVim](https://lunarvim.org)
- [Neovide](https://neovide.dev) (only sometimes, when I feel like watching the cool cursor animations)


# Color Theme

I'm using a uniform colour scheme for every piece of software I'm using (browser, code editors, terminals, GTK and QT apps, this website, etc).
[It's hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/.themes).
