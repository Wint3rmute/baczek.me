One day, I'd like to have more free space at home, so I can fill it with
various forms of art. It always felt uneasy to select any specific painting or
other object as "something I'd like to have on my wall for the rest of my
life". To make the process easier for me, I'm slowly collecting a list of
candidates here:

{{image (src="/paintings/das_eismeer.jpg" small=true title="Caspar David Friedrich - The Sea of Ice")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/summer_day.jpg" small=true title="Frits Thaulow - Summer Day")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/bjerk_i_storm.jpg" small=true title="Johan Christian Clausen Dahl - Birch Tree in a Storm (it looked SO MUCH better irl I can't believe it)")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/cabinet_of_an_art_lover.jpg" small=true title="Attributed to Hieronymous Francken II - The Cabinet of an Art Lover")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/die-toteninsel-iii.jpg" small=true title="Arnold BÃ¶cklin - Isle of the Dead (version III)")}}
