One day, I'd like to have more free space at home, so I can fill it with
various forms of art. It always felt uneasy to select any specific painting or
other object as "something I'd like to have on my wall for the rest of my
life". To make the process easier for me, I'm slowly collecting a list of
candidates here:

{{image (src="/paintings/das_eismeer.jpg" small=false title="Caspar David Friedrich - The Sea of Ice")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/summer_day.jpg" small=false title="Frits Thaulow - Summer Day")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/bjerk_i_storm.jpg" small=true title="Johan Christian Clausen Dahl - Birch Tree in a Storm (it looked SO MUCH better irl I can't believe it)")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/cabinet_of_an_art_lover.jpg" small=false title="Attributed to Hieronymous Francken II - The Cabinet of an Art Lover")}}
{{image (src="/paintings/die-toteninsel-iii.jpg" small=false title="Arnold BÃ¶cklin - Isle of the Dead (version III)")}}

{{image (src="/paintings/holy_mountain.jpg" small=false title="A still from *The Holy Mountain* (1973). Have not yet decided which specific still to pick, this is just a proposition to my future self")}}

{{image (src="/paintings/beautiful_bacteria.jpg" small=false title="One of the pages from *Beautiful Bacteria: Encounters in the Microuniverse*")}}
