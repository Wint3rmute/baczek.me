- Hiking maps application by [IGN.fr](https://www.ign.fr/) has the best maps I've
  seen so far in France. [Mapy.cz](https://en.mapy.cz/) work nicely as well.
- We gave up while climbing Montagne Sainte-Victoire (near Aix-en-Provence) due
  to lack of proper equipment. Remember to get bring warmer clothes next time!

# Thailand/Bangkok - visited in 2024

- Bangkok is one of the warmest cities in the world, expect extremally humid air
- In restaurants, every person on te table gets an extra empty plate, so that
  they can easily try the dishes ordered by other people. I've seen Thai people
  using primarly those "extra" plates, treating the ordered dishes as a buffet
  meal. I see it as a very positive custom, encouraging sharing and tasting different foods.

# Norway - visited in 2023

- [Trolltunga](https://maps.app.goo.gl/LcFPiWkw4qqSXYGL8)
- When hiking from sea level up to ~500m it will be all fine and dandy. Above
  500m things start to get tricky, after you pass ~700m be ready for very steep
  slopes.

- If you're traveling by car, here's a list of [scenic
  routes](https://www.nasjonaleturistveger.no/en/routes/) worth driving through
- Czech application [Mapy.cz](https://mapy.cz) has proved very useful around
  both Bergen and Hardangerfjord, it contains high quality hiking maps
- [Weather website](https://www.yr.no/en) served by the Norwegian
  Meteorological Institute
