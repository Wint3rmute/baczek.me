title: Cosmic Horror
---

Cosmic horror explores the idea that the higher forces of the universe
(supernatural beings, gods, etc) either do not care about or act against
humans. Our morals and values are juxtaposed against a completely indifferent
world, which functions in a way incomprehensible to our brains.

Cosmic horror has fascinated me since childhood, especially when mixed together
with body horror or biomechanics, so I'm keeping my humble list of related
material on this page.
