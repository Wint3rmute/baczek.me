title: Caddy web server
---

Caddy is an open source web server, an alternative to the well known NGINX.
Caddy is written in Go and uses a far more intuitive configuration file.

This site runs on Caddy :)

*TODO*: write more on modern replacements of classic C programs:
- leftwm
- nix
- paru
- neovide
- alacritty
