title: Caddy web server
---

[Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) is an open source web server, an alternative to the well known NGINX.
Caddy is written in Go and uses a far more intuitive configuration file (this is my subjective opinion, however I could argue that caddy's configuration files almost always will be shorter than NGINX's due to their structure and sane defaults). 

This site runs on Caddy :)
