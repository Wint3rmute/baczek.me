## üõ∞Ô∏è Space

I am currently developing mission control software at [Creotech
Instruments](https://creotech.pl/). Proud to be a part of the
[EagleEye](https://creotech.pl/news/the-polish-satellite-eagleeye-is-a-breakthrough-project-for-the-space-sector/)
project - the largest satellite built by a Polish company so far!

### Previous job - [SatRev](https://satrev.space/)

Between 2020 and 2023 I was working at [SatRev](https://satrev.space/) - a
company designing a CubeSat satellite fleet for commercial and research usage.

From 2021 to 2023 I led Satrev's mission operations software team -- that's
where we design the communication & telemetry systems of our satellites, create
the tools used for automated testing and finally talk with the satellites on
orbit.

Involved into a wide scope of satellite creation processes: prototyping, tests and ground station operations,
I have gained a significant insight into the design philosophy of space systems and I'm still eager to learn more.

Three of the satellites I've worked on were launched on the [first commercial
Virgin Orbit
flight](https://virginorbit.com/the-latest/virgin-orbit-selected-to-launch-satrevolutions-constellation-of-constellations/)
and the rest was launched by SpaceX's Falcon 9.

## ‚úàÔ∏è UAVs

From 2019 to 2023 I was a member of the [Academic Aviation
Club](http://akl.pwr.edu.pl) - a student club from my university, dedicated to
developing autonomous airplanes and drones. I've got the know-how to develop on
top of [ArduPilot](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot)-based flight
controllers, designing systems aimed both for fully autonomous operation and
for human-aircraft(s) cooperation.

I've attended [SAE Aero Design 2020](https://www.saeaerodesign.com/) and my team has placed second in the Advance cathegory.

## üêß Linux

Since my first Linux install I've fallen in love with it's customizability and
flexibility. Since then, I've been using it everywhere I could ([my Kindle
runs Arch btw](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/arch-linux-on-kindle)). I've a
solid knowledge base on Linux-related tools: from building embedded linux
distributions to Docker-based deployments and infrastructure as code.

During my time at the university, I was engaged in educating fellow students
about Linux and how it can enhance their lives as programmers, as I found that
part missing from the study programme. I organised Linux-related lectures,
providing students with knowledge necessary to transition away from
Windows/MacOS. I managed to keep a regular schedule of the lectures during the
entire semester and gathered 200+ people on a dedicated Facebook group.
Seeing a positive response from a large group of students was a truly
magical experience and the effort was definitely worth the time!

## üêç Python, web development

> This section is outdated and contains too many different things, I'll rewrite
> it on the nearest occasion.

Python is my primary language, as I do lots of prototyping and automation. In
my high-school years, after getting a grip on the basics of programming, I've
turned to broadly defined web development, which has been my passion for the
last years of high school and first years of uni. I enjoy glueing together
weird contraptions, exploring ideas around networking and interactivity.

I've been field tested during [Nokia Innovative
Projects](https://github.com/nokia-wroclaw/innovativeprojects), scoring a
second place with a project of a global, team-based RTS game -
[Consquare](https://marekchoinski.com/consquare/) (kind of like Pokemon Go,
except you actually get to affect the world map around you, not just change the
color of some statically placed structures on the map). We wrote the mobile
game client in Unity and the server software in Django.

## üåå The future?

### Programming

My current self development plan is centered on Rust. Strong and rich type
systems are my main topic of interest. From a more product-focused perspective,
I want to become an expert in developing performant and highly reliable mission
control software.

### Engineering in general

I've been leading teams of programmers both at university and at work and I'd
like to continue working as a leader. I have a fairly good instinct at setting
goals and creating a positive work environment. Moving from being a developer
to a more leadership-oriented role has also sparked my interest in system
engineering - a field which I have been recently pursuing.
