## UAVs

Since 2019, I've been rolling with the [Academic Aviation Club](http://akl.pwr.edu.pl) - a student club from my uni,
dedicated to developing autonomous airplanes and drones. I've got the know-how to develop on top of ArduPilot-based flight controllers.

As a confimation of my skills: I've attended [SAE Aero Design 2020](https://www.saeaerodesign.com/) and my team has placed second in the Advance cathegory.

## CubeSats

During the summer of 2020 I've started my internship at [SatRevolution](https://satrevolution.com/) - company
designing a cubesat satellite platform for commercial and research usage.

I worked on the telemetry & testing systems, doing some fancy code generation and
automating the testing/building processes. Gained a great insight into low level and
C++ during the internship. I am currently working there (as of February 2021).

## Linux

Since my first Linux install (was 16 back then), I've fallen in love with the customizability and
flexibility of this operating system. Since then, I've been using it everywhere
I could ([my Kindle runs Arch btw](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/arch-linux-on-kindle)).

I've a solid knowledge base on Linux-related tools: from shell scripts to Docker containers.
In my spare time, I'm running Linux-related lectures on my uni, trying to teach more people
about the advantages of the OS and providing them with knowledge for a painless transition to Linux.

## Python & WebDev

Python is my primary language, as I do lots of prototyping and scripting. In my high-school years,
after getting a grip on the basics of programming, I've turned to WebDev, which has been my passion
for the last years of high school and first years of uni.

I've been field tested during [Nokia Innovative Projects](https://github.com/nokia-wroclaw/innovativeprojects),
scoring a second place with a project of a global, team-based RTS game - [Consquare](https://marekchoinski.com/consquare/)
(kind of like Pokemon Go, except you actually get to affect the world around you, not just change the color of some
statically placed structures on the map). We wrote game in
Unity and the server software in Django.

## The future?

I've started programming with C/C++, then switched to high-level languages and technologies.
My plan is to go full circle and return to low-level - probably with Rust. I'll try to combine
my Linux knowledge and low-level programming (backed by high-level prototyping and testing),
to develop on embedded devices or to build high-performance server/desktop apps.
