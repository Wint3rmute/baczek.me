Collection of piano pieces which strike a good balance between being easy to
play and still sounding beautiful. You should find the sheet music online
without problems:

- Koji Kondo - Song of Storms
- Aphex Twin - Avril 14th
- Coldplay - Postcards From Far Away
- A Winged Victory for the Sullen - The Haunted Victorian Pencil
- Ryan Lott - [wintermute](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/Wintermute/blob/master/wintermute.pdf)
- [Crystal Castles - Kept (Waltz piano)](https://youtu.be/KpF1RzgSl0c?si=N408_VsEI4eERzzO)
- Cloud Atlas - Main Theme

I usually find myself stressed when playing in public, even
though I know most of those songs by heart. Keeping a list like this is meant
to make me remember what I can play :)
