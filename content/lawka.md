This page is dedicated to benches, placed in convenient locations, offering a
place to rest and enjoy scenic/calming/whatever views. I appreciate well-placed
benches a lot for some reason, hence I'm collecting my favourite ones right
here.

If I ever get awfully rich, I'm going to start a real *Ławka Initiative*,
funding benches across places in Poland to improve the tourist experience we
currently have.

*todo: add some more pictures of benches*

Hey you! Yes, the one that's staring at the screen! You have any cool pictures
of benches? Send them over [to me](/contact).
