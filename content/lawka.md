{{definition(word="Ławka" definition="a bench", source="todo: remove this field")}}

This page is dedicated to benches, placed in convenient places, offering a place to rest and enjoy scenic/calming/any views. I appreciate well-placed benches a lot, for some reason, hence here I'm collecting my favourite ones.

*todo: add the actual pictures of benches*
