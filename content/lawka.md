{{definition(word="Ławka" definition="Polish word which means ,,bench''", source="")}}

This page is dedicated to benches, placed in convenient locations, offering a
place to rest and enjoy scenic/calming/whatever views. I appreciate well-placed
benches a lot for some reason, hence I'm collecting my favourite ones right
here.

If I ever get awfully rich, I'm going to start a real _Ławka Initiative_,
funding benches across places in Poland to improve the tourist experience we
currently have.

_todo: add some more pictures of benches_

Hey you! Yes, the one that's staring at the screen! You have any cool pictures
