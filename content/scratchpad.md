Nexus page linking to all of my never finished project ideas, so I can get them out from my head.

- **[Flying Shooting Game](/flying-shooting-game)** - jetpack meets Ultrakill meets outrun style meets attack on titan.

- **[Lab Assistant Game](/assistant)** - AI agents were all over the place, so I wanted to prototype a game around them.

- **[Search Registry Manifesto](/search-registry-manifesto)** - ramblings on search engines enshittification.

- **[Custom Hardware Synth](/synth)** - learned soldering while tinkering on this!

- **[GPU Synth](/gpu-synth)** - honestly I'm never gonna learn physical modeling, let alone on a GPU.

- **Graph-based life simulation** - TODO: write on this one
