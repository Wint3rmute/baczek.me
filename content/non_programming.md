## ðŸŽ¹ Music

I've been through a music school, learning piano for 6 years (also boosting my typing speed, which came in handy later).
I spend most of my time with music, exploring genres and artists that I find interesting.

Some of my favourite picks:

- Kate Bush
- Son Lux
- Vulfpeck
- Leonard Cohen
- Peter Gabriel
- Brian Eno
- Yazoo
- The Punch Brothers
- Bryan Ferry
- Adam Neely

I'm currently fascinated by electronic sound design, exploring various approaches to sound synthesis --
programming and DSP knowledge proved surprisingly useful here. Hopefully I'll soon find more time to combine
those two domains and maybe write a custom sequencer or something similiar to jam on :)
