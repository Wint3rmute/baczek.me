title: The word *Bączek*
tags: journal, meta
---

My last name, _Bączek_, has multiple meanings. Here I've collected my favourites:

- Spinning top (the toy that spins)
- Spins, barrel rolls and other similar aerial maneuvers (in Polish we call that _kręcić bączki_, which roughly translates to _spin a bączek_)
- Fart (which leads to many funny/cringey) situations as people often call me by my surname rather than my name

**And the winner goes to:**

> A diminutive form of the word _Bąk_ (Bumblebee)

Here's a collection of hand-picked Bączek pictures, following this interpretation:
