title: The word *Bączek* in Polish
tags: journal, meta
---

My last name, *Bączek*, has multiple meanings. Here I've collected my favourites:

- Spinning top (the toy that spins)
- Spins, barrel rolls and other similar aerial maneuvers (in Polish we call that *kręcić bączki*, which roughly translates to *spin a bączek*)
- Fart (which leads to many funny/cringey) situations as people often call me by my surname rather than my name


**And the winner goes to:**

> A diminutive form of the word *Bąk* (Bumblebee)

Here's a collection of hand-picked Bączek pictures, following this interpretation:
