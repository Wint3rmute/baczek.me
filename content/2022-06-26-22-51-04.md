title: Open source tools
---

This is a collection of tools that I'm using instead of centralised/proprietary software.

I know there are a lot of similar lists out there, so I'll only list the lesser known programs

# Presentations

- The quick way: write them in markdown and use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/demos.html) to convert them into a presentation (I recommend using the revealJS slide show)
- The longer but more customizable way: use beamer (try [Metropolis Theme](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/metropolis-beamer-theme/qzyvdhrntfmrfor) for a sleek, minimal look)

# Excel (and spreadsheets in general) 

- Just use the python interpreter (or `ipython` if you wanna get fancy) for quick calculations. 
- Try [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) if you're working on something bigger

# VPN
