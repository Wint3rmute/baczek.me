I've been through a music school, learning piano for 6 years (also boosting my typing speed, which came in handy later).
I spend most of my time with music, exploring genres and artists that I find interesting.
I'm also using open-source tools to [transcribe music](/music-transcribing).

Some of my favourite picks:

- Kate Bush
- Son Lux
- Baasch
- Vulfpeck
- Leonard Cohen
- Peter Gabriel
- Rysy
- Brian Eno
- Yazoo
- The Punch Brothers
- Bryan Ferry
- Adam Neely


## DSP programming superpowers

I'm currently fascinated by electronic sound design, exploring various approaches to sound synthesis -
programming and DSP knowledge proved surprisingly useful here. Hopefully I'll soon find more time to combine
those two domains and maybe write a custom sequencer or something similiar to jam on :)

I've written a simple FM/PM synthesizer in Rust, you can check
it out [here](git@github.com:Wint3rmute/nosna.git).
