title: Colour scheme
---

![A screenshot of my desktop](/color_theme.jpg)

I'm using a single colour scheme for every piece of software I'm using
(browser, code editors, terminals, GTK and QT apps, this website, etc).

Having a uniform, system-wide theme has been my dream since I first heard of
desktop ricing.
