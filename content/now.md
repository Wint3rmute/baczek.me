<!-- Going back to my Invidious MR adding Prometheus metrics. -->

```
0X.01
```

Finished migrating my cloud & home instrastructure to [NixOs](/nixos). It
really feels like an improvement over Ansible playbooks (although I am still
using them for copying files & running system rebuilds, it is the easiest
solution for me), as I can merge custom software builds/packaging with the system
setup & configuration. Learned a bit about [`nftables`](https://nftables.org)
in the process.

Trying out some funky rhytms - learning how to play Beastly by Vulfpeck. Amazed
to see that they've made [an official
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQRV0c1KXYc) on that song and some
others.
