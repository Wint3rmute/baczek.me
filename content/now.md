Setting up [Unbound](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/)
on [NixOs](https://wiki.nixos.org/wiki/Unbound)
to simplify navigation in my internal services.

## 0X.02

Going back to my [Sonification project](/sonification). Working on configuration
system, focusing on something that's easy to start with and offers optional
in-depth configuration. In the process, I learned about [loghub](https://github.com/logpai/loghub).

Giving [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh) one more try.

## 3X.01

[Network drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), quite
surprisingly, are something I never had to set up in my sysadmin/devops carrier.
Today, I decided to finally stop wasting time with copying my movies via
`rsync` or `scp`. As usual, the [NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Samba)
provided a great example to get me started. Within minutes, I was browsing my
homelab's movie directory from a Finder-managed
[Samba mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) on my [macbook](/m4).

Positively surprised to see that rewinding through a movie works with no
noticeable delay, I couldn't tell I'm running off a network mount.
[Mpv player](https://mpv.io) even has a small UI widget visualising how it
buffers the movie locally, great stuff!

Android's VLC also supports Samba shares, had no trouble
connecting and streaming vids in 1080p. There's also
[CIFS Document Provider](https://github.com/wa2c/cifs-documents-provider),
although it lacks in the UX department and tends to hang when opening 50MB+ PDFs.
