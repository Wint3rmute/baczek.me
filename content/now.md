Hiking at Duszniki Zdrój.

Work on
[Wintermute](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/Wintermute)
is almost finished, but I still have no idea what
key the song is in. Nevertheless, the generated MIDI sounds
close enough to the original melody and the rendered notes
look almost proffesional.

Went to the

Glad to see many people interested in the genre. Saw
[Hainbach](https://www.hainbachmusik.com/) live! After the concert he invited
everyone interested to take a look at his setup and
ask questions about it, super nice!

TODO: Find out about this amazing Krzysztof guy who was
making absolutely stunning live visuals to Hainbach's music.

Attempting to force my brain into not being 100% active right from the early
morning all the way to late night hours - a habit I unwillingly developed while
doing my master's degree and working at the same time. It's becoming a burden
which could potentially lead to a burnout. I'm taking some time off, reading
more books, trying to focus more on direct physical experiences rather than my
thoughts.

It seems like one has to periodically embrace or fight against their own
introspection and modeling capabilities. Developing mental models of various
problems, systems, and situations, especially in the context of the role that
one plays in them, is no doubt an essential skill when it comes to any kind of
engineering (or any job which is done by one than one person). Unfortunately,
if the desire to constantly improve those mental models is let astray, it leads
to degradation of the models due to constant overthinking and breaking the
feedback loop, validating the model against reality.

Started using my physical motebook for more than just a worse version of Google
Calendar. I've designated some dedicated space to various projects and "thought
categories". Taking notes while reading is also less distracting, so I
recommend it to anyone who has trouble remembering all the ideas which come to
their mind while getting through a book.

Decided to finally organize my [excellent words](/excellent-words) list.

Wrote a small tutorial about [making music on Linux](/making-music-linux).

Discovered [Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com/) - a
full-featured DAW which I can run from Linux. Together
with [Diva](https://u-he.com/products/diva/) it
creates an amazing environment which uses way less CPU
than Windows + Ableton and feels much more intuitive,
at least for me.

Grabbing some air after the last master's semester. I'm glad to notice that my
mind has again started to produce ideas for extending my projects. Starting to
rewrite [Libretakt's](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/libretakt) user interface
to work as a website-based remote controller to the sampler engine. Networking
code is going to get simpler as the a single sampler instance is meant to be
run only locally. [Egui](https://egui.rs) should work just fine for a mobile-first
user interface.

Converted my [website map](/map) generation algorithm from using TFIDF to [text
embeddings](https://www.sbert.net/), I'm seeing a lot of improvement in how the
generated map looks! It's a pretty lightweight solution (if you're not counting
the `torch` library which is a behemoth), the embeddings only weight ~90MB.
The embeddings really capture the general context between posts that they put
closely together.

Switched all my computers to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), automated the
process of deploying my [system
configuration](/linux). Spent some time merging
my configuration repositories and documenting the result.

Exploring ideas related with genetic programming, mainly how one should
represent the structure of an optimisation problem in a form that would be
viable for genetic programming approach. [Mixed type cartesian genetic
programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224041240_MT-CGP_Mixed_type_cartesian_genetic_programming)
was the most interesting approach so far.

[Gerald Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) on [why MIT
has switched from Lisp to
Python](http://wingolog.org/archives/2009/03/24/international-lisp-conference-day-two)
in their introductory programming courses:

>Engineering in 1980 was not what it was in the mid-90s or in 2000. In 1980,
>good programmers spent a lot of time thinking, and then produced spare code
>that they thought should work. Code ran close to the metal, even Scheme -- it
>was understandable all the way down. Like a resistor, where you could read the
>bands and know the power rating and the tolerance and the resistance and V=IR
>and that's all there was to know. 6.001 had been conceived to teach engineers
>how to take small parts that they understood entirely and use simple
>techniques to compose them into larger things that do what you want.
>
>But programming now isn't so much like that, said Sussman. Nowadays you muck
>around with incomprehensible or nonexistent man pages for software you don't
>know who wrote. You have to do basic science on your libraries to see how they
>work, trying out different inputs and seeing how the code reacts. This is a
>fundamentally different job, and it needed a different course.

Trying to wrap my head around the database-centered
(Postgres-centered in my case) approach to building web
applications, especially:

- Declarative APIs, taken from the DB model (think [Hasura](https://hasura.io/))
- Storing business logic in the DB instead of relying on application-level validation

Learning how to minimize writing glue code and focusing on delivering value.
