Using last free days after christmas/new year to do some work on my infrastructure:

- All of my [hosted services](/decentralisation) are now rate-limited. Sorry, bots!
  - Rate limiting is not very agressive, but [contact me](/contact) if you encounter issues
- Everything is now [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) compliant
- I've set up [Borg backup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) for private stuff on my homelab. It's now using a multi-level backup strategy:
  - RAID1 on ZFS
  - ZFS snapshots (working on it)
  - Backup to a remote location via Borg
- I have migrated away from Google Photos and Google Drive, everything is now
  kept on my private cloud
