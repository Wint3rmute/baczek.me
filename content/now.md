Switched all my computers to [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/), automated the
process of deploying my [system
configuration](/linux). Spent some time merging
my configuration repositories and documenting the result.

Exploring ideas related with genetic programming, mainly how one should
represent the structure of an optimisation problem in a form that would be
viable for genetic programming approach. [Mixed type cartesian genetic
programming](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/224041240_MT-CGP_Mixed_type_cartesian_genetic_programming)
was the most interesting approach so far.

Started collecting some [thoughts on thinking](/how-to-think).

Switched to [Nu Shell](http://www.nushell.sh/), learning about new ideas for OS
shells which Nu is exploring.

Automating the deployment of my system configuration with
[Ansible](https://github.com/Wint3rmute/dotfiles/blob/master/playbook.yml).

[Gerald Sussman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerald_Jay_Sussman) on [why MIT
has switched from Lisp to
Python](http://wingolog.org/archives/2009/03/24/international-lisp-conference-day-two)
in their introductory programming courses:

>Engineering in 1980 was not what it was in the mid-90s or in 2000. In 1980,
>good programmers spent a lot of time thinking, and then produced spare code
>that they thought should work. Code ran close to the metal, even Scheme -- it
>was understandable all the way down. Like a resistor, where you could read the
>bands and know the power rating and the tolerance and the resistance and V=IR
>and that's all there was to know. 6.001 had been conceived to teach engineers
>how to take small parts that they understood entirely and use simple
>techniques to compose them into larger things that do what you want.
>
>But programming now isn't so much like that, said Sussman. Nowadays you muck
>around with incomprehensible or nonexistent man pages for software you don't
>know who wrote. You have to do basic science on your libraries to see how they
>work, trying out different inputs and seeing how the code reacts. This is a
>fundamentally different job, and it needed a different course.

Had a breakthrough moment with Lisp, finally
understanding the idea behind "code is data".
Rethinking my approach to type systems and
programming language architecture. All things
Lisp-related are food for thought :)

Trying to wrap my head around the database-centered
(Postgres-centered in my case) approach to building web
applications, especially:

- Declarative APIs, taken from the DB model (think [Hasura](https://hasura.io/))
- Storing business logic in the DB instead of relying on application-level validation

Learning how to minimize writing glue code and focusing on delivering value.

Did a minor contribution to [Mutable Instruments' documentation
repo](https://github.com/pichenettes/mutable-instruments-documentation). Glad
to see that I'm getting more comfortable with suggesting patches to various
open-source projects! Also glad that it's possible to "just submit" a
suggestion to software written by a prominent artist. Despite all the
negativity coming from the media and politics, we live in a great age :)

1. Trying to improve the [website map](/map) using Graphviz's
   [gvmap](https://graphviz.org/docs/cli/gvmap/). The clusters represented
   below have no real meaning, I've added them just to see whether this idea
   makes any sense visually.

    {{image (src="/testing_gvmap.jpg" small=true noshadow=true title="Prototype of
    the website map generated with <code>gvmap</code>")}}

1. Recently edited posts are now marked with an indicator: {{image
   (src="/recent_emoji.jpg" small=true noshadow=true title="")}}

1. Added a simple tags system to post metadata, will help with map generation.
