## 3X.01

[Network drives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_File_System), quite
surprisingly, are something I never had to set up in my sysadmin/devops carrier.
Today I decided to finally stop wasting time with copying over movies via
`rsync` or `scp`. As usual, the [NixOS Wiki](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Samba)
provided a great example to get me started. Within minutes, I was browsing my
homelab's movie directory from a Finder-managed
[Samba mount](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samba_(software)) on my [macbook](/m4).

Positively surprised to see that rewinding through a movie works with no
noticeable delay, I couldn't tell I'm running off a network mount.
[Mpv player](https://mpv.io) even has a small UI widget visualising how it
buffers the movie locally, great stuff!
