Implemented the first prototype of automated mind mapping, using word vectorisation
and out of the box graphing algorithms. I'm gonna need more content on the site
for this feature to be useful.

It looks promising when run on blogs with lots of content:

*Posts on [XXIIVV](http://xxiivv.com/), plugged into the visualisation script*

*Note:* honestly, I'm cheating in this example. Blog's author, [Devine](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/site/devine_lu_linvega.html),
is writing all the links to related pages manually. Because of this, text vectorisation has
no problems with connecting the dots :) On the other hand, this experiment made me more confident
that semi-automatic generation of related blog entries in a graph form is not a bad idea,
as the resulting graphs look promising.
