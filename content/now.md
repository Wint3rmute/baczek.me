Did a minor contribution to 
[Mutable Instruments' documentation repo](https://github.com/pichenettes/mutable-instruments-documentation).
Glad to see that I'm getting more comfortable with suggesting patches
to various open-source projects!
Also glad that it's possible to "just submit" a suggestion to
software written by a prominent artist. Despite all the negativity
coming from the media and politics, we live in a great age :)

1. Trying to improve the [website map](/map) using Graphviz's [gvmap](https://graphviz.org/docs/cli/gvmap/).
The clusters represented below have no real meaning, I've added them just to see whether this idea makes any sense visually.

{{image (src="/testing_gvmap.jpg" small=true noshadow=true title="Prototype of the website map generated with <code>gvmap</code>")}}


2. Recently edited posts are now marked with an indicator:
{{image (src="/recent_emoji.jpg" small=true noshadow=true title="")}}

3. Added a simple tags system to post metadata, will help with map generation.
