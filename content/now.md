<!-- Going back to my Invidious MR adding Prometheus metrics. -->

Broke my whole IT infrastructure for 12+ hours due to a trivial mistake in
static IP configuration. I haven't noticed it until late afternoon, the fix was
rather easy but I learned a bit about `nmcli`. Funny adventure, worth it :)

Week 1 of going to the gym!

Bought a used Octatrack unit. I already have to hold myself back
from tinkering with it instead of during house chores. Once I
connect my piano to it I'm gonna be out for at least a few days
:) The workflow is wonderful and the idea of having a single main
macro know is both simple and effective.

Finished migrating my cloud & home instrastructure to [NixOs](/nixos). It
really feels like an improvement over Ansible playbooks (although I am still
using them for copying files & running system rebuilds, it is the easiest
solution for me), as I can merge custom software builds/packaging with the system
setup & configuration. Learned a bit about [`nftables`](https://nftables.org)
in the process.

Trying out some funky rhytms - learning how to play Beastly by Vulfpeck. Amazed
to see that they've made [an official
tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQRV0c1KXYc) on that song and some
others.
