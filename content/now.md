### 0X.00

Enjoyed [MYTHOLOGICS #5 : BLAME!](https://youtu.be/HiKr0-vZSIM?si=SKrqX2mMGRUClKGz).

Gave the website a moderate CSS overhaul to improve visual gripping. Reading
longer pages felt like battling a wall of text, hopefully it no longer feels
that way.

### 3X.10

I am no longer hosting Invidious and Redlib. The maintenance hosts were too
high. Configuration was breaking every 2-3 months and I don't have the resources
to keep on maintaining those applications. Hosting both Invidious and Redlib
taught me a lot about Linux, SSL, containers, deployments in general. I have
tremendous respect for the maintainers of both cations. Hosting both Invidious

### 2X.10

Monitoring is paying off again. Today I woke up to a Telegram notification from
Prometheus, saying that my "ZFS pool is unhealthy". That's due to Prometheus
alerts coming from the [ZFS exporter](https://github.com/pdf/zfs_exporter) on my
[NixOS homelab](/nixos).

I used [Grafana Drilldown](https://play.grafana.org/drilldown) for the first
time, finding ZFS error metrics was quick & easy. There were no errors however!
A quick look at `zpool status` is telling me that one of 2 drives I'm using for
personal data storage is reporting write errors. Investigating. Run some SMART
tests, `smartctl /dev/sda1 -a` shows that they are all passing...

Right now I'm suspecting a driver issue rather than a hardware failure, it seems
to be connected to a long uptime. I haven't touched my servers for a long time
and I have a vague memory of a similar incident almost a year ago.

### 1X.10

Sad to say that my ThinkPad x260 is near its end-of-life for a daily use
laptop.  Given 2 Firefox tabs open with Spotify in one of them, it cannot
handle this + some simple programming. I know, the website bloat is to blame
and all of that. But I simply don't have the means to fix any of this.

Bought a MacBook Air M4. Documenting my adventures [here](/m4).

### 3X.08

Migrated my image gallery to [Immich](https://immich.app/), as NextCloud is
too slow for me. Taking up to few seconds just to load a webpage with a list of files/folders is unacceptable. Apart from that, the Nextcloud mobile application often behaves weirdly when browsing through large folders of images. Sadly, it seems like there's no mature open source replacement for Nextcloud as of now.

On the other hand, Immich is lightning fast when running on the same machine as
Nextcloud. The mobile app is on-par with Google Photos. To my surprise, Immich's machine
learning module recognizes the _"Pepe"_ keyword and lets me quickly browse
through the collection of the green frogs we all know and love. The future is
here.

As expected, I [self-host](/decentralisation) Immich on my [NixOS](/nixos)
homelab. If you're using Immich, I suggest supporting them at
[buy.immich.app](https://buy.immich.app/)!

Exploring [Copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty) as a lightweight
Nextcloud alternative.

### 0X.07

Continuing with my vibe-coding detour with [ReqSnake](/reqsnake). Migrated away
from Cursor free tier to Claude Code and I am blown away with the experience.
The comparison is no way fair, as I moved from free-tier Cursor to paid-tier
Claude, but I am still blown away. Claud suggests multiple useful patterns and
implements them quite effortlessly. It taught me about a feature of Python I did
not know - [Protocols](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/spec/protocol.html).

By the way, I'm absolutely loving [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) right
now. While working with Claude, I've been tweaking its configuration while the
AI was coding. The feature set of Ruff is out of this world, autofixes work
flawlessly and it all runs **so darn fast**. Best tool I've seen when it comes
to force LLMs to write quality code without a ton of prompts.

Discovered [Carceri d'invenzione](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carceri_d%27invenzione),
strangely similar to my beloved [Blame](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blame!),
but 300 years younger.

Vibe-coding (there, I said it!) a small application for [requirements
management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management) within
Markdown files. Sounds like the right project scope for the current maturity of
coding agents. The UX of [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) has been really nice
so far!

### 1X.06

Organizing my software design & specification knowledge as my team size is
growing. I currently manage 8 people directly and around 3 indirectly. My
semi-formal style with clearly described tickets but no well-formalized
overarching vision is no longer scaling. I'm talking something more than
[ARCHITECTURE.md](https://matklad.github.io//2021/02/06/ARCHITECTURE.md.html)
and a set of design notes on an internal wiki.

Learning about enterprise-scale requirements management software, such as [IBM
Doors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOORS) and [Enterprise
Architect](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Architect_(software)>).
They cause **so much** mental overhead and seem to be tailored for a
_blue-collar_ _Windows-only_
_I-will-not-stand-anything-that-is-not-reminiscent-of-msoffice_ mindset. I
wonder if anything like this, but much more minimal, can be created for
developers. Can't we just have a set of tags for Markdown/RST documents? With a
[lockfile](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/cargo-toml-vs-cargo-lock.html)
to detect changes/inconsistencies (such as accidentally removing requirements)
and VCS integration to track status changes in Git?

### 0X.06

While playing around with 2 really nicely designed Rust frameworks,
[Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) and [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/), I
realized that my trusty old ThinkPad x260 is having trouble keeping up with my
development workflow. A peek at [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop)
reveals that:

- `rust-analyzer` is using around 4GB of RAM
- `rustc` is peaking around 1GB
- Firefox tabs are taking around 2GB
  - ... and don't even think about launching Spotify! Btw: unexpected gem - [ncspot](https://github.com/hrkfdn/ncspot)
- Add OS usage to the mix and you will soon run out of RAM!

Being too lazy to write a long post about how mad I am about increasing
resource requirements, I bought a 16GB RAM module and replaced my current 8GB
module. RAM issues gone. Thank you, ThinkPad!

### 3X.05

Finished my second reading of Blindsight, a book unbelievably densely packed
with philosophophical and technological concepts, hidden in a labirynth of
techincal jargon. My favorites:

- Form Constant (Klüver constant)
- Being No One (Thomas Metzinger)

.. of course, the core plot twist is also on my list , but I'm not gonna reveal
it here!

New quotes are lading in [the quotes room](/thinking).

After reading online reviews, possible similar materials:

- Remaining books by Peter Watts, obviously
  - [Also a talk of his](https://youtu.be/v4uwaw_5Q3I?si=mikXz-B8uJJfKAEN)
- Greg Egan
  - Diaspora
  - Permutation City

### 2X.05

Trying to get more comfortable with CAD software. Every now and then, during a
lazy Sunday afternoon, I dedicate 2-3 hours to measure and model a random object
at my house. CAD-based modeling is far more intuitive to me than Blender-like
workflows. Perhaps my mind is deeply shaped with programming-based approaches
to things and I find parametric modeling to be a reflection of declarative
programming. Well, whatever works.

### 1X.03

Thinking about data sonification again. [The Digital
Heartbeats](https://youtu.be/J81WQrIBrpw?si=nBZ0eAcowzNqSEZM) sparkled some new
ideas in my mind. Using code coverage data ([Python's
trace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/trace.html), [Clang's
SanitizerCoverage](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/SanitizerCoverage.html)) as it
runs in real time could be used to draw visualisations or play sonifications
describing what's going on. I'm pondering on an idea of the _shape_ of a
running program and how it could evolve with different usage patterns of the
same application. If the visualisation/sonification tool is written correctly,
the _shape_ could be preserved between application versions, altering only
slightly.

Took a small movie-making (or rather video-tutorial-making) task at work, to
get a break from programming/managing/whatever it is that im currently doing.
Happy to report that DaVinci Resolve works like a charm on Linux, with full
GPU support! Together with Bitwig, i can basically do whatever I want, without
leaving the comfort of my Arch setup.

Using last free days after christmas/new year to do some work on my infrastructure:

- All of my [hosted services](/decentralisation) are now rate-limited. Sorry, bots!
  - Rate limiting is not very agressive, but [contact me](/contact) if you encounter issues
- Everything is now [HTTP/3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3) compliant
- I've set up [Borg backup](https://github.com/borgbackup/borg) for private stuff on my homelab. It's now using a multi-level backup strategy:
  - RAID1 on ZFS
  - ZFS snapshots (working on it)
  - ZFS snapshots with `sanoid`
  - Backup to a remote location via Borg
- I have migrated away from Google Photos and Google Drive, everything is now
  kept on my private cloud
