title: Colour scheme for everything
---

![A screenshot of my desktop](/color_theme.jpg)

I'm using a single colour scheme for every piece of software I'm using (browser, code editors, terminals, GTK and QT apps, etc).

Having a uniform, system-wide theme has been my dream since I first heard of desktop ricing.
