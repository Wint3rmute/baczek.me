title: Decentralisation
---

As many other people who run their own websites (and often other
web infrastructure), I'm interested in keeping the internet
diverse and decentralised.

## Decentralised/self-hosted/privacy-first online services

I'm running self-hosted online services. They are public, you can
use them too :)

- [SearX](https://searx.baczek.me), a meta-search engine

- [LibreY](https://librey.baczek.me), another meta-search engine

I also recommend the following services for private use:

- [Immich](https://immich.app/)

- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

- [Matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/)

- [Gitea](https://gitea.com/)

- [Copyparty](https://github.com/9001/copyparty)

> some random thoughts on search - [registry-based search engine manifesto](/search-registry-manifesto)

## Notes on self-hosting, suggested software

1. Monitor the metrics of every service you've hosting (Prometheus)
2. Visualise your metrics (Grafana)
3. Ping everything from time to time (Blackbox exporter)
4. Setup notifications when a service goes down
5. Automate everything from the start, you won't regret it
6. As your infrastructure (and knowledge) grows, you will eventually need _infrastructure as code_
   - Or even better, just use [NixOs](/nixos)
