## FLOSS software

My recommendations on [open source software](/open-source-daily-guide).


## Decentralised/self-hosted online services

-

I'm running self-hosted online services. They are public, you can use them too :)

- [Invidious](https://invidious.baczek.me), an alternate YouTube frontend
- [SearX](https://searx.baczek.me), a meta-search engine


I also recommend the following services for private use:

- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)
