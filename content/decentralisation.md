## Decentralised/self-hosted online services


I'm running self-hosted online services. They are public, you can use them too :)

- [Invidious](https://invidious.baczek.me), an alternate YouTube frontend

- [SearX](https://searx.baczek.me), a meta-search engine

- [Librex](https://librex.baczek.me), another meta-search engine


I also recommend the following services for private use:

- [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com/)

- [Matrix](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/) 


>new idea, work in progress - [registry-based search engine manifesto](/search-registry-manifesto)


## Notes on self-hosting

1. Monitor the metrics of every service you've hosting (Prometheus)
2. Visualise your metrics (Grafana)
3. Ping everything from time to time (Blackbox exporter)
4. Setup notifications when a service goes down
5. Automate everything from the start, you won't regret it
6. As your infrastructure (and knowledge) grows, you will eventually need *infrastructure as code*
