# Starting point

Here's a bunch of opinions I have on writing and storing notes/ideas/etc:

- It's always good to be able to make notes, drafts or even full pages from
  your phone. It feels good to use a smartphone for something other than
  content consumption.
- CI/CD or other repository automation is a good idea, no matter what project
  you're working on.
- Use git to store your content, use any other tool you like for
  viewing/writing/visualisation.
- Markdown is most probably all you need. Remember that you can always extend
  markdown - almost all static site generators allow you to spice up your
  markdown notes, for example Zola has
  [shortcodes](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/content/shortcodes/).

# Resulting design

- Site is generated by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). It's blazing fast and
  written in Rust, what more to ask for? I'm using a custom script for
  [exocortex-related processing](/map).
- For taking notes from a mobile device I use [Termux](https://termux.dev/en/) (precisely from [Nix-on-Droid](https://github.com/nix-community/nix-on-droid))
  and [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/).
- CI/CD builds the site for me, then my server pulls it automatically
