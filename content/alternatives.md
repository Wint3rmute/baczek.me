title: Alternatives to C/C++ software
---

# Justification/philosophy

Most of the software, that powers this world runs on C and C++. I do not mean to criticise those languages, as they were both a great improvement for the programming community, opening new and exciting paths to better software. However, during the last 2 decades, new languages have emerged, fulfilling the need for:

- Better library/package management
- Memory safety
- Improved approach to macros and other metaprogramming-related aspects
- Integrated documentation builders

# List of alternatives to classic software written in C/C++

*Lesser-known first to keep the list interesting*
