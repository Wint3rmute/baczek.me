I encourage you to compare the documentation of the software from this list with their *classic* alternatives, just to see how important good documentation is. 

# Justification/Philosophy

Most of the software, that powers this world runs on C, C++ and Java. I do not mean to criticise those languages, as they were both a great improvement for the programming community, opening new and exciting paths to better software. However, during the last 2 decades, new languages have emerged, fulfilling the need for:

- Built-in tools for easy code reuse (package/library management)
- Memory safety
- Speed & resource efficiency
- Improved approach to macros and other metaprogramming-related aspects
- Integrated documentation builders (`cargo doc` as a prime example)
