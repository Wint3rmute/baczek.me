Here's a small list of programs which I use as alternatives to classic
UNIX-and-related tools. Lesser-known first to keep the list interesting:

- [LeftWM](https://leftwm.org) - a window manager
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/) - a text editor
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/documentation/overview.html) - `tmux` alternative, batteries included
- [Nu](https://www.nushell.sh/) - cross-platform shell with a fresh approach to streams & redirections
- [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/overview/) - a static site generator, which powers this website
- [Paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru) - AUR helper for all Arch folks
- [Neovide](https://neovide.dev) - `neovim` client with eye-candy animations
- [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) - a web server with automatic HTTPs and refreshingly simple configuration
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) - a terminal emulator
- [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) - another terminal emulator
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - a smarter `cd` command
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - Fuzzy finder for pretty much everything
- [fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - unix `find` but actually usable without having to read `man` each time
- [duf](https://github.com/muesli/duf) - like `df` but easier to read
- [Popsicle](https://github.com/pop-os/popsicle) - USB File Flasher

I encourage you to try them out, perhaps some of them will improve your
workflow or at least be fun play with.
