I encourage you to compare the documentation of the software from this list with their *classic* alternatives, just to see how important good documentation is. 

# Justification/philosophy

Most of the software, that powers this world runs on C and C++. I do not mean to criticise those languages, as they were both a great improvement for the programming community, opening new and exciting paths to better software. However, during the last 2 decades, new languages have emerged, fulfilling the need for:


- Better library/package management
- Memory safety
- Improved approach to macros and other metaprogramming-related aspects
- Integrated documentation builders
