# Day 1

It's 7PM and I brought the thing from the store. Conversed for a while with an
LLM to tell me crucial OS differences and recommended keyboard shortcuts, given
a Linux power-user background.

Fired up an update to the latest MacOS version and installed Nix immediately.
The recommended multi-user install script worked right out the box, tested with
a simple `nix-shell -p cowsay`.

The next step (as I understood based on my reddit/LLM/Kagi queries) was to
install [Nix Darwin](https://github.com/nix-darwin/nix-darwin), so that I can
manage system-level MacOS configuration. Used it to install some basic CLI
tools like `nvim`, `cargo`, `btop`. Installed XCode Dev Tools along the way as
a OS-level popup told me so, nice.

Rust is compiling, Neovim is running, no issues there.

I was unable to configure [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/) due to a cryptic error:

```
Unable to open swap file for "<any path i try to edit>", recovery impossible
```

On plain Neovim, this simply appears and then I can edit the file. On
AstroNvim, the error appears and then it snaps back to the file explorer,
preventing me form editing anything. Sometimes it opens the file but shows it
as both empty and read-only. I'm assuming that's a permission issue I don't yet
understand. Will continue tommorow. Working from VSCode (installed via Nix) and
a Vim plugin, that's almost close enough.

Day one UX issues as a convert:

- Lacking middle click for opening new tabs
- The ``` key is in a **weird position** on this keyboard!
- The deal with apps not closing when I hit the red "close" button

# Day 2

Contrary to AstroNvim, Helix works from the get-go

Incoming!
