# TODO: finish

*Trying to build a productive music-making environment as a Linux purist.*

## The Setup

- *TODO:* details on setting up JACK on an Arch Machine. [Arch Wiki
  page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/JACK_Audio_Connection_Kit) should work
  just fine.
- [QjackCtl](https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/) is a useful GUI app for managing
  your JACK configuration, it comes packaged in most Linux distros.

## The DAW

In my opinion, the most mature DAW available for Linux is
[Bitwig](https://www.bitwig.com). It is somewhat pricey and is not open-source.
However, it makes up for it with its broad range of available synths, effects
and other features. The UI feels snappy and very intuitive. On my personal
machine I feel like Bitwig is 1.5-2x times faster than Ableton in "just doing
the general DAW stuff".

If you feel more adventurous and would like to try a more *experimental*
interface, [Bespoke](https://www.bespokesynth.com/) could be the DAW for you.

## The VSTs

- Anything from [U-he](https://u-he.com/products/) should be great if you're
  willing to pay for it
- [Dragonfly Reverb](https://github.com/michaelwillis/dragonfly-reverb) is a
  good sounding reverb, which comes in multiple variations
- Arch Linux's [pro-audio](https://archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/pro-audio/)
  package group provides a lot of up-to-date VSTs (and also other audio-related
  programs)

## The controllers

It seems like Novation's [Companion](https://us.novationmusic.com/components)
software is built around
