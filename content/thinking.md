Collection of resources improving reasoning, empathy, planning, understanding.
Selected by the merit of how much they feel relevant to my own biases and
fallacies I fell for.

Some quotes I simply enjoyed.

> All to often in life, we see people do what we want them to do and we say
> nothing, assuming that the behavior has become natural for them, as easy

I cannot extract any specific fragment which would do it justice and the
entirety is too long to paste here. Anyway, the lyrics are **fire**.

**Louis Cole - Quality Over Opinion.**

> People aren't actually moved by competence at all. Competence is actually one
> of the least moving things in the world. You're moved by something being
> resonant and clear. There's an amount of competence that's necessary to get
> something to be clear and then there's superfluous competence, which is
> whittling away all the life in it.

_TODO:_ shorten this stuff, cmon man.

> Machines, after all, are conceived, designed, and constructed by people. By
> human standards, machines are pretty limited. They do not maintain the same
> kind of rich history of experiences that people have in common with one another,
> experiences that enable us to interact with others because of this shared
> understanding. Instead, machines usually follow rather simple, rigid rules of
> behavior. If we get the rules wrong even slightly, the machine does what it
> is told, no matter how insensible and illogical. People are imaginative and
> creative, filled with common sense; that is, a lot of valuable knowledge built
> up over years of experience. But instead of capitalizing on these strengths,
> machines require us to be precise and accurate, things we are not very good at.
> Machines have no leeway or common sense. Moreover, many of the rules followed
> by a machine are known only by the machine and its designers. When people fail
> to follow these bizarre, secret rules, and the machine does the wrong thing,
> its operators are blamed for not understanding the machine, for not following
> its rigid specifications. With everyday objects, the result is frustration.
> With complex devices and commercial and industrial processes, the resulting
> difficulties can lead to accidents, injuries, and even deaths. It is time to
> reverse the situation: to cast the blame upon the machines and their design. It
> is the machine and its design that are at fault. It is the duty of machines and
> those who design them to understand people. It is not our duty to understand the
> arbitrary, meaningless dictates of machines.

> Brains are survival engines, not truth detectors. If self-deception promotes
> fitness, the brain lies. Stops noticing— irrelevant things. Truth never

> Whole species is agnosiac by default.

> Chaos darkened the holy brightnesses of the unconscious world. Hierarchies

> effected by the invention on the basis of language of an analog space with an
> analog 'I'. The careful elaborate structures of the bicameral mind had been
> shaken into consciousness.
