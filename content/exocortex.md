As many other people, I'm building a website storing pieces of knowledge which
I find interesting, mostly notes on technical, artistic and philosphical
matters. I'm also using the website as a journal.

In my case, it is neither a blog nor a
*[Zettelkasten-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)* system. I'm
implementing custom visualisation software, utilising natural language
processing and high-dimensional data exploration/visualisation methods. You can
take a look at the [map](/map) if you're interested.

To put it shortly: I'm building a system which will automatically
group my thoughts and infer connections between them.

Apart from the cool-sounding plans about mind map generation, I'm constantly
trying to improve both the [website experience](/website-experience) and my
[content creationg workflow](/content-creation-workflow) using all the FLOSS
software I can find or write myself.

I hope that exploring this website will be a positive experience for you!
