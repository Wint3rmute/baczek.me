The purpose of this website is to store the most valuable parts
of knowledge I have gained over the years: technical, artistic, philosophical.

In my case, it is not a notes dump nor a 
*[Zettelkasten-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)* system.

I'm experimenting on a custom idea visualisation system, utilising
natural language processing and high-dimensional data exploration/visualisation methods. You can
take a look at the [map](/website-map) if you're interested.

To put it shortly: I'm building a system which will automatically
group my thoughts and infer connections between them.

Apart from the cool-sounding plans about mind map generation,
I'm constantly trying to improve both the [website experience](/website-experience)
and my [content creationg workflow](/content-creation-workflow) using all
the FLOSS software I can find or write myself.
