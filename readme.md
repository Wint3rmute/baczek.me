# Building

I'm using [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/). You can either install it and build the site
yourself or use `docker-compose.yml`, which will do everything for you.

*Note*: `docker-compose` is configured to deploy into an `caddy` server, so you might have to adjust
it for your configuration if you use another server software.
