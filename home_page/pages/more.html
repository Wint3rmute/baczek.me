<h3>More about me</h3>
<hr>

<h4>UAVs</h4>

<p>Since 2019, I've been rolling with the <a target="_blank" href="http://akl.pwr.edu.pl">Academic Aviation
        Club</a> - a student
    research circle from my uni, dedicated to developing autonomous
    airplanes and drones. I've got the know-how to develop on top
    of ArduPilot-based flight controllers.</p>
<p>
    As a confimation of my skills: I've attended
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sae.org/attend/student-events/sae-aero-design-east/">SAE Aero Design
        2020</a>
    and my team has placed second in the Advance cathegory.

<h4>CubeSats</h4>

<p>During the summer of 2020 I've started my internship at <a target="_blank"
        href="https://satrevolution.com">SatRevolution</a> - company
    designing a cubesat satellite platform for commercial and research usage.
</p>


<p>
    I worked on the telemetry & testing systems, doing some fancy code generation and
    automating the testing/building processes.
    Gained a great insight into low level and C++ during the internship. I am currently
    working there (as of December 2020).

<h4>Linux</h4>
<p>
    Since my first Linux install (was 16 back then), I've fallen in love with
    the customizability and flexibility of this operating system. Since then,
    I've been using it everywhere I could (<a target="_blank"
        href="https://github.com/Wint3rmute/arch-linux-on-kindle">my
        Kindle
        runs Arch btw</a>).
</p>

<p>
    I've a solid knowledge base on Linux-related tools: from shell scripts to Docker containers.
    In my spare time, I'm running Linux-related lectures on my uni, trying to teach more people about
    the advantages of the OS and providing them with knowledge for a painless transition to Linux.

<h4>Python & WebDev</h4>
<p>
    Python is my primary language, as I do lots of prototyping and scripting.
    In my high-school years, after getting a grip on the basics of programming, I've turned to WebDev,
    which has been my passion for the last years of high school and first
    years of uni.
</p>
<p>
    I've been field tested during <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nokia-wroclaw/innovativeprojects">Nokia
        Innovative
        Projects</a>,
    scoring a second place with a project of a global, team-based RTS game -
    <a target="_blank" href="https://marekchoinski.com/consquare/">Consquare</a>
    (kind of like Pokemon Go,
    except you actually get to affect the world around you, not just change the color of
    some statically placed structures on the map). We wrote game in Unity and the
    server software in Django.
</p>


<h4>The future?</h4>

<p>
    I've started programming with C/C++, then switched to high-level
    languages and technologies. My plan is to go full circle and
    return to low-level - probably with Rust. I'll try to
    combine my Linux knowledge and low-level programming
    (backed by high-level prototyping and testing),
    to develop on embedded devices
    or to build high-performance desktop apps.
